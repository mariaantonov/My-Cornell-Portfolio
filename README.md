This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a website is a phishing site or a legitimate site using the PhishingURLsDataset, which contains URLs labeled as phishing (1) or legitimate (0). Implemented in Python, the project utilizes libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The model employs TfidfVectorizer for text vectorization, with performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve analysis. Future work may explore more complex models and additional feature engineering to further enhance predictive performance.
